	* protocol.py: rewrote registerHandler code, it seem to have disappeared...

09/06/2004 Marcel van Rensburg <iddqd@mail.berlios.de>:
	* all files: renamed to lowercase
	* Control.py, Parser.py, standard.py: merged code into protocol.py
	* join.py, nick.py, pong.py, user.py: moved to irc/messages
	* Control.py, Parser.py, standard.py: removed from project
	* protocol.py: did some general touch-ups to the parsing code
	* protocol.py: removed isConnected and associated bool,
		added userRegistered bool to avoid race condition whereby
		derived classes could queue messages before the initial NICK and USER
	* join.py: removed '#' from __str__-returned string - channels may start
		with a different symbol
	* protocol.py: fixed indentation bug causing only last messages to be
		processed, as opposed to each and every message
	* all files: added license information
