pychat
Python IRC Client
=================

* start an identd server
* respond correctly to identd requests
* not interfere with any identd process which may exist already
* resume dcc failures
* track bot disconnects and reconnects
* reconnect upon server disconnection
* work only within a specified time range (i.e. it would be best to stay off the net from 8am to 4pm)
* email end user when fatal errors occur and for each successful transfer
* extract archives (.tar, .gz, .rar, .zip, etc.) and verify files
* provide a web interface (is this THAT important? possibly.)
* cycle through a list of names to prevent name collision
* be extensible
* be configurable
